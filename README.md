# Mazer  
Mazer is a random maze generator  
Launch test.py to run a test  

The progam will ask the width and the height for the labyrinth.  
**The both values must are odd numbers!**  
*If you enter a even number, it will be incremented by 1.*  

Commands are :  
- **quit** : to quit the program.  
- **gen** : to generate another maze.  
- **save** : to create a txt file of the maze (! the previous will be over-written).
